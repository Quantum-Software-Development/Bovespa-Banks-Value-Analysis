## Presentation Overview

Created by **Fabiana Campanari**, this project includes a complete video presentation for a Statistics course. In this project, I assumed the roles of art direction, design, and sound remixing üé∂. The focus of the analysis is on the **Value Added and Its Distribution in Bovespa Banks**.

Statistics need not be tedious. I transformed data into a visual and auditory narrative that captivated the class's attention. The presentation team was responsible for delivering the content, utilizing my video alongside supplementary materials in PowerPoint and PDF formats.



## Analysis of Value Added and Its Distribution in Bovespa Banks

This repository presents an in-depth examination of how Brazilian banks created and distributed value, focusing specifically on their wealth distribution practices. By employing the **Demonstration of Value Added (DVA)** and statistical methods such as ANOVA, we analyzed the differences in value creation and distribution among national and foreign banks listed on BOVESPA.

The project encompasses a presentation video and supplementary materials, including PowerPoint slides and a detailed PDF report, all designed to engage and inform audiences about significant disparities in wealth allocation among these financial institutions. By translating complex data into a clear and compelling narrative, we aim to illuminate the economic impact and responsibilities of banks in Brazil.




## Objective of the Study

The study investigates how Brazilian banks generated and distributed wealth, focusing on the division of value among employees, government, financiers, and shareholders.

## Methodology
The research employed the **Demonstration of Value Added (DVA)** and ANOVA analysis to compare value distribution practices among national and foreign banks. A total of 28 banks listed on BOVESPA were analyzed, categorized into groups to facilitate a thorough examination.



## Key Findings
1. **Differences between National and Foreign Banks**:
   - Foreign banks exhibit distinct differences from national banks concerning value added and compensation policies.
   
2. **Concentration of Value Added**:
   - Ita√∫, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, and Santander collectively accounted for 85% of the total value added.
   
3. **Distribution Policies**:
   - Santander and HSBC demonstrate differing practices, particularly in employee compensation and taxes paid to the government.
   - Despite differing ownership structures, Ita√∫ (private) and Banco do Brasil (public) display similarities in their value distribution practices.



## Conclusions
This study highlights the unequal distribution of value, particularly between foreign and national banks. The **Demonstration of Value Added (DVA)** serves as a crucial tool for analyzing corporate accountability and the economic impact of banking institutions.
